# Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree
- An implementation of a Binary Tree with the traversal methods PreOrder, InOrder, and PostOrder
- An implementation of a Binary Search Tree with search and add methods

## Challenge
- Create a Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree data structures with tests

## API
### Binary Tree
- PreOrder(O(n))
- PostOrder (O(n))
- InOrder (O(n))

### Binary Search Tree
- Add (O(log n))
- Search (O(log n))
