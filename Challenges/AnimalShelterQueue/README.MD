# Animal Shelter Queue

## Challenge
Make an animal shelter that behaves like a queue (FIFO) and uses my own implementation of a queue. Animals in the shelter are cats and dogs and if specified returns the first requested animal in line.

## Approach & Efficiency
### Enqueue()
* Big O Time = O(1) // Big O Space = O(1)
	- The time of this algorithm is O(n) and and the space is O(1).
### Dequeue()
* Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(1)
	- The time of this algorithm is O(n) and and the space is O(1).
