# Multi Bracket Validation

## Challenge
Write a method that takes a string of brackets as an argument and returns true if the brackets are balanced and false if they are not

## Approach & Efficiency
* Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(n)
	- The time of this algorithm is O(n) and and the space is O(n).
