# Kth Node From End

## Challenge
Using your own implementation of a Linked List, write a method that takes in an integer value and finds the kth node from the end of a linked list and return the value of the node.

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Big O Time = O(n)
	- Iterating through linked list once

2. Big O Space = O(1)
	- Does not allocate additional memory
