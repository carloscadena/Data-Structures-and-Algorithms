# Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Challenge
Create a method that takes in a tree and returns the maximum value in that tree

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time = O(n)
	- This method needs to hit every node within a binary tree to check values and add the string to a list.

Big O Space = O(h)
	- This method utilizes a preorder binary tree method that traverses our binary tree recursively for the height of the tree.
