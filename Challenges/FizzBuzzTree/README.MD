# FizzBuzz Tree

## Challenge
Create the a game that behaves like the classic FizzBuzz game but does so with a tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time = O(n)
	- This method needs to hit every node within a binary tree to check values and add the string to a list.

Big O Space = O(h)
	- This method utilizes a preorder binary tree method that traverses our binary tree recursively for the height of the tree.
