# Calcuate Nth Number of Fibonnaci Sequence

## Challenge
Write a method called FibonnaciSeq that takes in a number and calculates the nth number of the Fibonnaci Sequence

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(n)
	- The time of this algorithm is O(n) and and the space is O(n).
